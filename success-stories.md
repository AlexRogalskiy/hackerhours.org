> The people at Hacker Hours helped me so much when I ran into a problem. I remember Aidan showed me about a really cool gem that I had never heard of that solved a big problem I was having.

> To beginners I'd say don't be afraid, just go. It's a totally laid back environment where people just want to help each other out and are totally cool talking to beginners and experts alike. Even if you just want to go there and work on your own, it's a lot of fun.

> I emailed you about a junior role we had available at Yodle, and after you sent the note out to Hacker Hours, we were inundated with resumes. Which was awesome. It was kindof a tricky position because of the skill sets involved, and I was so amazed that we got such great response. We ended up hiring two people who came from your group.

> Hacker Hours...is a place where programmers of all experience levels gather to help one another with their coding projects. We were so impressed by both the welcoming nature of the participants and the empowering process of intergenerational peer-to-peer instruction that we were eager to bring something similar to our own local community of teenagers.
