## Mailing list

You can read past messages to the mailing list [here](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/messages/archive/).

1. Make sure that the message fits into our [policies](/policies.html), specifically:
    * All messages (job postings, events, etc.) must be relevant to junior developers in NYC.
    * Any recruiting must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.
1. Join [the Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/).
    * This is required by the platform we use for our mailing list (meetup.com).
1. Send your message to [hackerhours-list@meetup.com](mailto:hackerhours-list@meetup.com).
    * You need to use the same email address as your meetup.com profile, or the message will silently bounce.

Note that we do it this way, rather than one of the organizers forwarding a promotional email, so that

* It's clear who recipients should follow up with.
* There is no appearance of endorsement.

Also note that the mailing list is moderated.
