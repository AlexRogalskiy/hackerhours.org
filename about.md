Hacker Hours are **free office hours for programming help - any programming language, all skill levels**. The format is super simple: you come with your laptop, sit and hang out and code, and flag down one of the organizers if you have a question.  That's it! If we can't answer your question, we'll find you someone who can, or at least point you in the right direction. More background:
