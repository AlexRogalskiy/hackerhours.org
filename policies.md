title: Policies
---

These policies apply to all Hacker Hours "spaces", which include: events, the Meetup group, the mailing list, the chat room, and all other forms of communication related to the group. **If someone is violating any of these policies or you feel uncomfortable in the group in any way, please [let one of the organizers know](/contact.html).**

## General

* Anyone is welcome, and everyone should _feel_ welcome.
* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](/contact.html)!

## Communications

* Messages to the mailing list and chat room *must be relevant to junior developers in NYC* (or location independent).
* The mailing list is limited to announcements.
    * Questions and other casual conversation are better suited for the chat room or the in-person events.
* Any recruiting emails to the mailing list must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.

## Code of Conduct

_Adapted from [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com/code-of-conduct.html)._

Hacker Hours is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, both online and off. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. No weapons or illegal drugs of any kind are allowed at Hacker Hours. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.

#### Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion (or lack thereof).
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberately calling someone a name or pronoun after being corrected.
* Sexual images or behavior.
* Physical contact (such as a hug or backrub) or simulated physical contact without consent.
* Any deliberate intimidation, threat, or incitement of violence.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual/romantic attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent, except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Hacker Hours prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort and therefore we will not act on complaints regarding:

* 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you".
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.
