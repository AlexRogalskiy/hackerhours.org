## General

* Anyone is welcome, and everyone should _feel_ welcome.
* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](/contact.html)!
* Messages to the mailing list and chat room *must be relevant to junior developers in NYC* (or location independent).
* The mailing list is limited to announcements.
    * Questions and other casual conversation are better suited for the chat room or the in-person events.
* Any recruiting emails to the mailing list must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.

Note this code of conduct applies to Hacker Hours events, the mailing list, the chat room, and all other forms of communication related to the group. If someone is violating any of these policies or you feel uncomfortable in the group in any way, please [let one of the organizers know](/contact.html).

## Code of Conduct

_Adapted from [Write/Speak/Code](http://www.writespeakcode.com/code-of-conduct.html)._

### The Quick Version

Our events and online spaces are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender and gender identity, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is never appropriate. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the organizers.

No weapons of any kind, or drugs are allowed at Write/Speak/Code.

### The Less Quick Version

Write/Speak/Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all Write/Speak/Code spaces both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Write/Speak/Code.

Some Write/Speak/Code spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

#### Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they're not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.
* Write/Speak/Code prioritizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort and therefore we will not act on complaints regarding:
* 'Reverse' -isms, including 'reverse racism,' 'reverse sexism,' and 'cisphobia'.
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you".
* Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial.
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.
