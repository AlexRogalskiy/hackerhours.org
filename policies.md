## General

* Anyone is welcome, and everyone should _feel_ welcome.
* Be respectful of one another.  This is a small community and there is no room for jerks.
* Recruiting is only allowed if the position is for junior developers, apprenticeships or internships.  We are also open to sponsorships (e.g. food + drink for an event) - [get in touch](/contact.html)!
* Messages to the mailing list and chat room can be coding/resource questions or announcements, but *must be relevant to junior developers*.
* Any recruiting emails to the mailing list must include `[JOB]` in the subject line.

If someone is violating any of these policies, please [let one of the organizers know](/contact.html).
